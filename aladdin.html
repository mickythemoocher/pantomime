<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Ahh, there you are Jasmine<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> I know what you are going to say father, and I don't want to do it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">But Jasmine my dear, you must be married by tomorrow, It is the law<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">As I have told you so many times I do not want to get married. And even if I did there is nobody that I would want to get married to<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Hmm, how about Price Ahmed, he is a very charming young man<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">No, he is too thin<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> Prince Mustafa?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> Too fat<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Then how about Prince Khalid<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> No, Too rich.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <i><font color="#000000">(Incredulously)</i><font color="#800080"> Too rich!! Too Rich!! My child, there is no such thing as too rich<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Yes there is, and he is it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emporer: <i><font color="#000000">(Mumbling to himself)</i> <font color="#800080">Too rich? Whoever heard of such a thing.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">If you make me marry father I shall just run away<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> Run away? Don't be so ridiculous. Here you have everything that you could ever desire. The worlds finest food, the finest dresses in the land, servants to cater for your every need and reaches beyond the dream of Everest<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">I think you mean avarice. Besides, I do not want any of those things, I just want to be free<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">But my sweet child you are free<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">No I am not father. I have not left this palace since the day I was born<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> That is to keep you safe my dear. Out there is a dangerous world. It is full of criminals, Robbers, Thieves and worst of all – politicians<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">I will take my chances. I cannot stand to be cooped up any longer<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">I implore you my dear. Never, ever think of running away. Out there is a dangerous place and A beautiful princess like yourself will always be in danger.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> I might enjoy a bit of danger, better than being cooped up here<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> Well it is your bed time now. I urge to to think very seriously about the marriage proposals you have and to accept one very quickly. By tomorrow at the latest. Goodnight my dear<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Goodnight father, and for the last time I do not want to be married.</font color="#800080"><p>

<font color="#000000">Scene Two  Outside Widow Twanky's House<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">I must have the two most stupid sons in the whole world<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">I would agree with that<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">That is rather unfair mum<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wish Washy:<font color="#800080"> Yes, surely there must be some sons somewhere that are more stupid than us<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">Shut up Wishy Washy<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">I send you out with the very last of our few coins to buy a loaf of bread and look what you come back with.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">I thought you would like it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu:<font color="#800080"> I told you she wouldn't<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> Why would I like it? It's a grubby old tarnished oil lamp<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy:<font color="#800080"> I think it looks quite nice<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">Shut up Wishy Washy<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu:<font color="#800080"> I think it looks like a grubby old tarnished oil lamp<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> The man at the market seemed very anxious to sell it to me.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> I am sure he did. What other idiot would want to buy it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy: <font color="#800080">I would<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin and Twanky:<font color="#800080"> Shut up Wishy Washy<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">So if you would like to know what we have for tea tonight, let me tell you. Old oil lamp and jam<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy<font color="#800080"> Washy: That doesn't sound very tasty<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> It won't be, but you idiot brother brought this back instead of bread<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> It seemed a bargain<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">Yes it was a bargain – for the man selling it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> Ohhh! It was a bargain was it? Well I just hope you to think it tastes good</font color="#800080"><p>
<i><font color="#000000">(Abanazer appears quite discretely)</i><p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> Good day to you all<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">Who are you?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">My name Madam, is Abanazer<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> I have heard of you<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">Yes, so have I and I heard that you are a very wicked man<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Oh no madam, not me<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Everyone:<font color="#800080"> Oh yes you are<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Oh no I'm not<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Everyone: <font color="#800080">Oh yes you are<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Oh no I'm not<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Everyone:<font color="#800080"> Oh yes you are<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Now, now, there must have been some kind of a mistake. I assure you I am a very kind and honourable man<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">All right, very pleased to meet you now goodbye<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">Be seeing you<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">You misunderstand. I was not just passing through. I came here to have a word with this young man<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">You mean Aladdin?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">If that is his name then yes, Aladdin<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> What do you want a word with me for?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu:<font color="#800080"> I have a bad feeling<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080">Well dear boy, you see, you have my lamp.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy:<font color="#800080"> It's not your lamp, it's his. He bought it with the bread money<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">For once, Wishy Washy is right. I did buy it and it is mine<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">The man who sold it to you actually stole it from me. It was not his to sell<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">That is just too bad. It is mine now<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy:<font color="#800080"> yes, we are having it for our tea<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer <i><font color="#000000">(Confused)</i><font color="#800080"> For your tea?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">Take no notice of him, nobody else does. Aladdin, give him the lamp it is just a piece of worthless junk anyway<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">No! I refuse to part with it. It is mine fair and square<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">I think you should give it to him<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Oh dear boy. I certainly wouldn't expect you to give it to me. I understand that you parted with money for it but I am quite prepared to give you a good profit<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> Sell it Aladdin<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu:<font color="#800080"> YES!!!! sell it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy: <font color="#800080">No, don't sell it Aladdin we will have nothing for tea<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Your mother is right, it is just a piece of junk but it has sentimental value to me. I could offer you 200 for it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <i>(Very loudly)</i> <font color="#800080">200? Don't sell it Aladdin<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu:<font color="#800080"> NO!!! Don't sell it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy: <font color="#800080">Why not mum?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> If he is offering 200 straight off, it has to be worth more<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">I am not going to sell it anyway<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> Not even for 300?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">Not even for five<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">There must be something rather special about this lamp for you to offer so much. Maybe my son is not as stupid as I think he is <p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy: <font color="#800080">I am though aren't I mum?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">Yes, you are dear<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">So what is so special about this lamp<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> It is not special to everyone, just to certain people. If you should try to rub the lamp a Genie will appear and grant you three wishes<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">What a load of twaddle. Genies? Wishes? You must think we are all idiots<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">He wouldn't be the only one<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy.<font color="#800080"> I think I am the only one<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer.<font color="#800080"> No, no. I assure you what I say is the truth<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">Well I have a wish. I wish you would clear out of here.<p>


<font color="#000000">Scene Three:   The Palace<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Whatever my father says, I will not get married and I will run away. In fact that is what I am going to do right now. And I don't want people to know I am a princess. I want to be treated like a normal person. No more servants, no more people telling me what to do. Freedom at last to be just who I want to be. I may even get a job! What fun.
 It will be a new life, Away from my controlling father and away from this awful palace. I will pack just a small bag. I want to live simply and freely. In fact I will start packing right now and slip out secretly while everyone else is asleep</font color="#800080"><p>

<font color="#000000">Scene Four:   The Street<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> So if this is a magic lamp as you say what about giving us a demonstration.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> |Errr yes I could do that but it may be a little difficult<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">Difficult in what way?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Well, the genie doesn't see me like me very much<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">I am not surprised<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">You mean he won't grant your wishes?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Maybe not<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> So what good is that then?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy:<font color="#800080"> Not much good at all I think<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky; <font color="#800080">We have heard enough of your nonsense now on your way</font color="#800080"><p>
<i><font color="#000000">( The Princess appears)</i><p>

<font color="#FF0000">(Everyone else):<font color="#800080"> Hello<p>
 <font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">I was wondering if you could help me<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> We'll try<font color="#000000"> ( quietly to himself) <font color="#800080">Oh my gosh, she is so beautiful.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> I just wanted to know - is this where ordinary people are?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy:<font color="#800080"> Ordinary people?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu:<font color="#800080"> Extraordinary would be more like it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Yes. You see I am an ordinary person and I thought it would be nice to be with other ordinary people<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">Oh I see.</font color="#800080">  <i><font color="#000000">( Quietly to himself)</i> <font color="#800080">I have just fallen in love<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> I suppose you could say we are ordinary<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Oh good! Can I just ask though, are any of you criminals, robbers, thieves or politicians?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">That feller there is probably all four<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Oh no I'm not<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy<font color="#800080">: I want to see the genie<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> How exciting. I had no idea ordinary people did things like that. (A short pause) Even though I am quite ordinary myself of course<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#000000">( Rather dreamily) <font color="#800080">Oh no, you are not in the least bit ordinary<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> Thank you kind sir. What a wonderful compliment. And may I say how handsome you are<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> You honour me with your sweet, wonderful, words ordinary person. I swear nothing could compare with your wondrous beauty<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky<i><font color="#000000"> ( a little exasperated)|</i><font color="#800080"> Oh get them a room somebody before I vomit up my breakfast.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy:<font color="#800080"> Can we see the genie now?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">Yes let's see it are all you all mouth and no trousers?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Very well then. Let me see now. I have to rub it three times then it should appear<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu:<font color="#800080"> I have heard that before</font color="#800080"><p>
<i><font color="#000000">( There is a loud whoosh noise)</i><p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">OUCH!!! I am always doing that, catching my arm on the way out<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> perhaps you should come out more slowly.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">I have been living in that awful lamp for 400 years the last thing I am going to do is come out slowly. Anyway, what do you want?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> I was hoping you would grant me three wishes<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">Ohh, so not worried about me then? Being stuck in that old oil lamp for 400 years, it's all about what you want<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> Just like all men<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">We thought that was what you were supposed to do. Grant wishes<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">Oh pardon me. I just spent 400 hundred years in there and all you want is wishes granted<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy: <font color="#800080">So can you grant wishes or not?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie:<font color="#000000"> ( After a short pause) <font color="#800080">I can - if I feel like it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">It would be awfully exciting to see – I am an ordinary person by the way<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">The most wonderful ordinary person in all the world<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Oh thank you kind sir<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">No, no, no. I want to be ordinary<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emeror: <font color="#800080">You can't be ordinary, you are a princess<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Everyone: <font color="#800080">A PRINCESS!!!!<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Yes a princess and she shouldn't be down here mixing with you ragamuffins<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">Please say you are not a princess. I want to marry you and someone as lowly as me cannot do that<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">Plenty more fish in the sea<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy.<font color="#800080"> The lamp Aladdin, what about the lamp?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">What do you mean the lamp. What has that got to do with anything? It's just an old lamp and a silly genie<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">Oh pardon me for breathing<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy: <font color="#800080">The lamp can grant three wishes<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">Only if I feel like it<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">I still don't see what you mean Wishy Washy<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">I do, what a wonderful idea<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy:<font color="#800080"> I thought I was supposed to be the stupid one<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">What's all this about lamps and wishes<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">All poppycock if you ask me<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> Don't you see Aladdin? It is your lamp and you can make three wishes. You could wish to be a prince then we can be married<p>
<font color="#FF0000"> Twanky:<font color="#800080"> He is not a prince he is just a very, very naughty boy<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">Oh my gosh yes! Wishy Washy, for once in your life you have been really smart<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy. <font color="#800080">Thank you<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Now just a minute I am not having my daughter marry someone who just wishes to be a prince<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> Allow me to interrupt your Majesty but if he uses the lamp, he won't just wish to be a prince. He will be a prince.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">And who the devil are you?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu:<font color="#800080"> He's the kind of man you have been warning your daughter about<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer: <font color="#800080">Oh no I'm not<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Everyone:<font color="#800080"> Oh yes you are<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Everyone:<font color="#800080"> Oh yes you are<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> Oh no I'm not<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Everyone else: <font color="#800080">Oh yes you are<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> Enough, enough of this foolishness<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie:<font color="#800080"> Yes, It's getting on my nerves.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">And who are you might I ask<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">Yes, you might. I am the Genie of the lamp<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">What does that mean?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie:<font color="#800080"> It means I have been stuck inside of that lamp for 400 years and and until somebody rubs it that is where I stay<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Rubs what?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">Oooh cheeky<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie:<font color="#800080"> Rubs the lamp of course<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> And then he grants three wishes<p>
 <font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#000000">(suspiciously) <font color="#800080">Supposedly<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> And hopefully he will grant three wishes for me and make me a prince<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Oh yes! Then we can be married<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Oh no you can't.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">But father, you said you wanted me married and it had to be by the end of today<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> I want you married to a prince, not a ruffian like this?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Wishy Washy: <font color="#800080">He is not a ruffian, he is my brother.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> And where do you think you are going to live? In this hovel that I see<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> Do you mind!!! This is my house <p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Hardly a palace is it?<p>
<font color="#FF0000"> Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Please father. Please let him make the wishes<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Certainly not<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Then I shall never darken your door again<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> Don't be so ridicules child<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie:<font color="#800080"> Don't I get a say in this?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Why should you?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">Because I am the one that grants the wishes<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky: <font color="#800080">Supposedly<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">And I may just not feel like it today<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> Please Mr Genie, please grant Aladdin his wishes. Already I am quite fed up with being ordinary<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> And so am I. I want to be a prince<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">I suppose I could be persuaded<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor:<font color="#800080"> I really want no more to do with this<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">I will make a deal with you father. Let Aladdin wish to be a prince and if you are still not convinced I will come back to the palace<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Emperor: <font color="#800080">Alright, I agree to that as it is such a ridiculous idea anyway<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> Oh thank you father. Aladdin, you must make your wishes<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin: <font color="#800080">Would that be ok Genie of the lamp?<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie:<font color="#800080"> I suppose so. Try to make them long ones. I am not looking forward to going back into that lamp for another 400 years<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> Abanazer, please pass me the lamp.<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> (Angrily) <font color="#800080">NEVER!! If I cannot have the lamp then nobody else will. Ha ha ha You will never be a prince Aladdin<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine:<font color="#800080"> Ohhh noo please give it to him<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> Never. I shall make the wishes. (hiss) I will become a prince (hiss) and then you will marry me<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">Not so fast Abanazer, you wicked man watch me everyone as I leap onto Abanazer's shoulder and snatch the grimy lamp from his grasp<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abanazer:<font color="#800080"> Stop you wretched monkey and give me that back<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Abu: <font color="#800080">Not a chance. Here Aladdin, catch<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Aladdin:<font color="#800080"> Got it!! Thanks Abu<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Genie:<font color="#800080"> I suppose so<p>
<font color="#FF0000"> Abanazer: <font color="#800080">You will all regret this<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Twanky:<font color="#800080"> Shut up you wicked old man<p>
<font color="#FF0000">Genie: <font color="#800080">Come on then Aladdin, what is your first wish? I advise you to wish carefully because once granted it cannot be undone.<p>

<font color="#FF0000">Jasmine: <font color="#800080">Ohh this is so exciting.<p>
